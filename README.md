## About

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my work, skills, and journey as a web developer and designer. This website is designed to provide you with insights into my projects, background, and the technologies that power it.

**Website URL:** [https://viralvanjar.netlify.app](https://viralvanjar.netlify.app)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML :**

    *The foundation of the website, HTML, structures the content and ensures proper rendering across different browsers.*
- **CSS :** 
    
    *The use of CSS for styling and layout design contributes to the site's clean, modern, and user-friendly appearance.*
- **JavaScript :** 
    
    *JavaScript enhances user interaction, providing dynamic and responsive features for an engaging experience.*
- **ReactJS :** 
    
    *For building a dynamic and single-page application, I've harnessed the power of ReactJS. This open-source JavaScript library makes it possible to create interactive user interfaces and seamlessly manage components. ReactJS also allows me to update content without requiring the entire page to reload, resulting in a faster and more user-friendly experience.*
- **Firebase (for backend support) :** 
    
    *Firebase Realtime Database allows for the storage and retrieval of data in real time, ensuring that the content on my website is always up-to-date and interactive*

## Features

- **Portfolio Showcase:**  you'll find a diverse range of work that showcases my skills and creativity.      
    **Text Editor:-** The Text Editor is a simple yet powerful web-based text editing tool. It provides users with a clean interface to write and edit text documents, making it a useful utility for various writing tasks.

        Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    
    **Dictionary:-** The Dictionary project is a dynamic tool that enables users to search for word meanings and translations in multiple languages. It harnesses the power of the Rapid API to access a vast database of words and definitions.

        Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integration with the Rapid API.

    **The Voiceinator:-** The Voiceinator is a unique project where I've implemented a voice synthesis feature using JavaScript. Users can input text, and the website will convert it into spoken words. It's an example of my creativity and proficiency in JavaScript.

        Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

    **Weather App:-** The Weather App is a handy tool for checking real-time weather information for any location. It leverages the Rapid API to fetch current weather data and displays it in a user-friendly format.

        Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integration with the Rapid API.

    **Snake Game:-** The Snake Game is a fun and nostalgic project that I created for entertainment. It's a classic game where users control a snake to collect items and grow longer while avoiding obstacles. It's a testament to my JavaScript skills and my love for coding just for fun.

        Technologies Used: JavaScript.

- **About Me:** I have given you a glimpse into my background, my experiences, and what drives me as a web developer and designer. It's important to me that you get to know the person behind this code.

- **Skills and Technologies:** See the tools I work with, from HTML, CSS, JavaScript to ReactJS, Firebase and Rapid API.

- **Contact Information:** Reach out, whether you have questions, want to collaborate, or just want to say hello.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
